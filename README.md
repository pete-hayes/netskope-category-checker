## Usage
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `ns_category_checker.html` in your browser
3. Click **Start**

The Child Abuse category is intentionally commented out in the code. Running tests against this category could generate traffic that appears in Netskope logs and reports, which may appear inappropriate and cause concern. 

## How It Works

When you click **Start**, the page goes through a list of example Netskope category FQDNs one by one. Each site is tested in the background and marked as **Accessible** or **Not Accessible**.

## Notes
- Because of browser Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) restrictions, the script cannot tell the difference between Netskope policy actions such as Block, User Alert, or Isolate. All of these outcomes appear the same to the browser and will be shown as **Not Accessible**.
- The *Child Abuse* category is intentionally commented out in the code. Running tests against this category could generate traffic that appears in Netskope logs and reports, which may appear inappropriate and cause concern. If you need to include it in your checks, you can remove the comment markers in the `items` array of the script to restore the entry.
